    Both the experts make a comprehensive comparison on how a people learn. Carol Dweck particularly makes an intriguing claim, supporting it with evidence, that people with a growth mindset have a higher chance of excelling in academically or professionally. She backs her claim with the study that she did on 7th graders, and how students with a growth mindset were substantially better academically with a constant growth, whereas, the students with a fixed mindset struggled with studies.

   Moreover, Derrick Mueller claims that being wrong makes you learn, as proving to yourself that you were wrong is the first step into the growth mindset, once you know that you are wrong then you can work on that subject and become more knowledgeable. As Stephen Hawking said, “The enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, but the illusion of having knowledge.”

   Furthermore, Carol Dweck reinforces her claim that a growth mindset is not something that you inherit genetically, it is something that can be acquired over time, on top of it, once you are working with a growth mindset your brain activity increases immensely relative to someone with a fixed mindset.

    Lastly, both experts state the same aspect that being wrong or failing is the first step towards learning. In addition, it is stated that it is okay not be smart, and if you are struggling with something you just need to work harder, and you will be able to overcome that hinderance.

    Anders Ericson in his study showed that every world class performer had once thing in common, all of them had invested at least 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in their field of work, this study supports the claim made by Carol Dweck of a growth mindset and working hard, and how both of these go hand in hand with each other.
